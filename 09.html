    <h1>뉴진스</h1>
    <h2>뉴진스</h2>

    <p>OMG</p>

    <h1>Only you</h1>
    <p>
        이 노래는 it's about you baby
        Only you
        You, you, you
        You, you, you, you
        내가 힘들 때, 울 것 같을 때
        기운도 이젠 나지 않을 때
        It's you 날 걱정하네
        It's you 날 웃게하네
        말 안 해도 돼
        Boy, what do you say?
        멀리든 언제든지 달려와
        (They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")
        바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나
        (They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")
        이게 말이 되니? 난 물어봐
        (They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")
        너는 말야
        He's the one that's living in my system, baby
        Oh my, oh my God 예상했어 나
        I was really hoping that he will come through
        Oh my, oh my God 단 너뿐이야
        Asking all the time about what I should do
        No, I can never let him go
        너만 생각나 twenty-four
        난 행운아야 정말로 I know, I know
        널 알기 전까지는 나 의미 없었어 전부 다
        내 맘이 끝이 없는 걸 I know, I know
        I'm going crazy, right?
        어디서든, 몇 번이든
        There ain't nothing else that I would hold on to
        I hear his voice through all the noise
        잠시라도 내 손 놓지 마 no, no
        걱정 없잖아 'cause I got someone
        혼자라도 괜찮아 'cause I love someone
        멀리든 언제든지 달려와
        (They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")
        바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나
        (They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")
        이게 말이 되니? 난 물어봐
        (They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")
        너는 말야

        He's the one that's living in my system baby
        Baby
        Baby
        Bae, baby
        I'm going crazy, right?
        Baby
        Baby, I'm going crazy, right?
        Bae, baby
        너와 나
        My heart is glowing, it's glowing up
        너랑만 있으면 무서울 게 없어
        가득 메워진, 다 메워진 (붉어진)
        My heart is glowing, it'd be glowing
        'Cause he
        Oh my, oh my God 예상했어 나
        I was really hoping that he will come through
        Oh my, oh my God 단 너뿐이야
        Asking all the time about what I should do (너와 나)
        No, I can never let him go
        He's right there for me twenty-four
        난 행운아야 정말로 I know, I know (너와 나)
        널 알기 전까지는 나 의미 없었어 전부 다
        어떡해?
        My heart is glowing, it's glowing
        My heart is glowing up
        So I can't sleep at night</p>
